/**
 * Rudimentary collision for model pieces: where drops rest when they land on
 * geometry instead of felt (tableplace-135).
 *
 * There is no physics engine and no gravity here — rest heights are computed
 * by `resolveDrop` — so "collision" is exactly one question: what is the
 * surface height under this (x, z)? Answered by a downward raycast against the
 * mounted meshes of every `kind: 'model'` piece, which `Model.svelte`
 * registers here. Highest hit wins; a hit at felt level (or none) answers
 * `undefined`, and the caller's fallback chain (`snap.y ?? surfaceYAt(x, z) ??
 * TABLE_TOP_Y`) does the rest.
 *
 * A raycast, not a bounding box, on purpose: a box top would float a token at
 * wall height when it was dropped *inside* a room — the ray finds the real
 * floor between the walls. Kit meshes average ~1.6k triangles, so per-frame
 * preview raycasts are cheap; if a huge map ever measures slow, three-mesh-bvh
 * is the drop-in.
