/**
 * Picking something up with no button held — the "carry it" half of the drag
 * pipeline, whose other half is `commitActiveDrag`.
 *
 * A press-and-hold drag cannot move a deck any more: since tableplace-161 the
 * deck's long press belongs to its wheel, and "Move pile" is a wedge on it.
 * That wedge fires on the release that chose it, so there is no button left to
 * hold — the pile has to follow the pointer on its own and land on the next
 * click.
 *
 * Nothing new is invented for that. `dragStart` is what makes an entity follow
 * the pointer (TableScene streams whatever `isDragging` names to the table
 * point on every pointer event, buttons or no buttons), the next release goes
 * through the same `commitActiveDrag` every drop does — snapping, deck
 * stacking, surface rest and all — and Escape still runs `cancelActiveDrag`,
 * which puts the pile back where the origin below says it was. One use, then
 * it is an ordinary settled entity again.
