/**
 * The dev-only handle the headless render harness (`e2e/`) drives the table
 * through.
 *
 * It exists because the class of failure #102 was reported for — a die or a bag
 * that poisons the shared raycast and freezes every pointer interaction on the
 * table — is invisible to jsdom: nothing there runs three.js geometry or a
 * raycast. Catching it needs a real GPU-less browser, real pointer events at
 * real pixels, and therefore a way to ask the live scene *where on screen* a
 * given entity is. That is all this is.
 *
 * Everything here is a read of live state or a call into `gameActions`, i.e.
 * exactly what the HUD panes already do — the harness spawns pieces the same
 * way a player does and then clicks them with a real mouse. Nothing in the app
 * reads this object.
 *
 * `import.meta.env.DEV` is a compile-time constant, so `installTestBridge` is
 * only ever called from a dev build (see `TestBridge.svelte`).
