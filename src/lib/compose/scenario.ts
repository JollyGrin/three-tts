/**
 * Headless scenario composition: a tbps scenario plus its already-resolved

 *
 * This is the entity-building half of `scenario.applyScenario`, lifted out of
 * the browser. Nothing here touches a store, Svelte, `localStorage` or the
 * DOM, so the same code that lays out a table in /play can lay one out from a
 * bun script (`scripts/seed-lobby.ts`) or from a future provisioning API —
 * same entity ids, same `seat0`…`seat3` placeholder owners, same `packOrigin`
 * stamps, same card order.
 *
 * Pack **resolution** is deliberately not here: fetching a `.tbpp.json` is I/O,
 * and keeping it out is what makes this testable and reusable. The caller
 * resolves (`scenario/resolve-packs.ts` in the browser) and passes the map.
