/**
 * The wheel must not be a more permissive way to touch a deck than the keybind
 * is. Both go through the hotkey wrappers, which is where the refusal wording
 * lives — so an opponent's deck refuses the wedge, says why, and mutates
 * nothing.
 *
 * (Cards have no ownership gate today: `F` flips whatever is under the pointer,
 * so the Flip wedge does exactly the same thing. The deck verbs are where there
 * is a rule to keep.)
