/**
 * The opener state machine: one press, two entry points, three outcomes.
 *
 *   right press → travel               → camera pan (we let go, OrbitControls
 *                                        never knew we were interested)
 *   right press → held still ~200ms    → flick wheel (move to a wedge, release)
 *   right press → quick release        → sticky wheel (move, then click)
 *   left  press → travel               → the entity's own drag, untouched
 *   left  press → held still           → flick wheel
 *
 * The entity only calls `armRadialPress` from its pointerdown and hands over a
 * way to abandon its own pending gesture (`onOpen`). Everything after that —
 * the timer, the movement veto, the highlight, the release — lives here on
 * window listeners, because a flick leaves the entity's pixel immediately and
 * OrbitControls captures the pointer to the canvas for the rest of the gesture.
 *
 * Nothing here reads a hover store to decide WHAT to act on: the target is
 * whatever the press landed on, carried through to the options (see actions.ts).
 * The one hover read is a veto — a piece under the pointer owns its own
 * right-click (bag draw / counter heal / state picker), so the felt behind it
 * must not open the table wheel.

 * answered at 350. A gesture whose timing depends on what is underneath it is
