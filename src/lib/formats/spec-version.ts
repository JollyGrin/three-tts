 * Spec versions for the tbpp/tbps document formats, and the reader policy
 * that makes old files keep working.
 *
 * Two version fields exist and they answer different questions:
 *
 * - `tbpp` / `tbps` — the in-band format discriminator. Identifies *which
 *   format* a file is, and gates the container shape (tbps 1 vs 2 are
 *   genuinely different layouts).
 * - `specVersion` — semver of the spec revision the document was authored
 *   against. Fine-grained enough to tell an additive change from a breaking
 *   one, and to fetch the exact schema from its release tag.
 *
 * Schema-side metadata alone is not enough: a file that has escaped into the
 * wild has to say what it was written against, or nothing downstream can
 * decide whether it is safe to read.

 * 1.4.0 — added per-card `orientation` (`'portrait' | 'landscape'`) to deck
 * cards and bag card items, additive: every earlier 1.x pack is still valid.
 *
 * 1.3.0 — added the `bag` piece kind (`contents`/`drawMode`/`infinite`),

/**
 * The scenario spec is deliberately 0.x: it is unstable and carries no

 * is the breaking component — says exactly that.
 *
 * Which means, while this is 0.x, an **additive** change bumps the PATCH, not
 * the minor. `breakingRank` below ranks 0.x by minor, so bumping the minor for
 * a new optional field claims a break that did not happen, and every 0.1.x
 * build then refuses files it could have read perfectly well. (The general
 * "additive → minor" convention in docs/packs.md § Release convention is the
 * 1.x rule; it inverts under 0.x.)
 *
 * 0.1.8 — snap points 2.0: optional elevation (`y`), the `kind: 'grid'`
 * variant (`pitch`/`cols`/`rows`/`yawStep`), and `snap: false` on pieces. All
 * optional fields on existing shapes — additive, so PATCH, not minor (two
 * workers have bumped 0.x wrong before; `check-schemas.ts` will not catch it).
 * 0.1.7 — `state.cards` (and bag card items) can carry `orientation`,
 * additive — so a PATCH bump, per the 0.x rule above.
 *
 * 0.1.6 — `state.pieces` can carry the bag fields (this schema is generated
 * from `Partial<GameDTO>`), additive.
