 * Click (or right-click) a bag to draw one item out of it — the same shape as

 * raycastable children (pouch, neck, count label), and Threlte queues the group
 * once per child the ray pierces, so an unguarded handler would draw two or
 * three items per click (tableplace-84).
 *
 * Claiming happens before the drag-threshold check, again matching the counter:
 * bailing out first would leak the event to the duplicate dispatch entry, which
 * would then draw.
