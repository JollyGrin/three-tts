/**
 * Snap points: where a drop is *pulled to*, as opposed to where the pointer
 * happened to be.
 *
 * The whole mechanic is this one pure function plus a branch in `resolveDrop`.
 * Nothing about a snap is synced on its own: the dropping client resolves the
 * point, writes the final position through the same move path as any other
 * drop, and the relay carries that — so both clients land on the identical
 * transform without any new machinery.
 *
 * A point with `kind: 'grid'` is a lattice of square cells rather than one
 * spot: a drop anywhere over its extent pulls to the nearest cell centre, and
 * the landing's yaw steps to the nearest `yawStep` multiple. Candidates from
 * grids and discrete points compete on distance; an authored discrete point
 * beats a generated cell on ties — authored intent over generated lattice.
