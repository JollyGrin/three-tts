/**
 * Resolve where the entity currently being dragged would land if it were

 *
 * This is the single source of truth for the drop: `DropIndicator` draws it
 * and `Table.handleDragEnd` commits it, so the preview cannot promise a
 * landing the release won't honour.
 *
 * `rawPoint` is the unclamped table raycast hit; when it's missing (pointer
 * off the table plane) the entity's own position is used instead so a drag
 * keeps previewing.
 *
 * The order is aimed-at targets first, proximity effects second, because a
 * target you pointed at should never lose to one you merely drifted near:
 *
 * - a **bag** under the pointer swallows a card or a piece (not a deck, and
 *   never another bag) — the tray still beats it for a card;
 * - **pieces** and whole **decks** then only ever settle: felt position, pulled
 *   onto an authored snap point if one catches them;
 * - a **card** goes: hand tray, hovered deck, Alt's opt-out, an authored snap
 *   point within radius, then the loose-pile square-up.
 *
 * A snap point beats a pile because it is authored intent rather than a side
 * effect of where cards drifted; Alt opts out of every kind of snapping at
 * once, but not out of the aimed-at targets.
 *
 * `options` carries what the release itself asks for (`noSnap`, from Alt) and
 * what the route actually mounted (`hand`): a target that isn't on screen
 * can't win a drop, even if a stale hover flag says the pointer is over it.
 * Both call sites — the indicator's preview and the commit — pass the same
 * object, which is what keeps the preview honest.
