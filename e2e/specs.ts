/**
 * What the harness checks.
 *
 * Every spec has the same spine, because #102 does: put something new on the
 * table, then confirm that *everything else* still answers the pointer and that
 * nothing new mounts broken. The shared `interactivity()` context (#86) means
 * one entity that throws during raycast takes dispatch down for the whole
 * table — and a Svelte effect that reads state it also writes is worse still,
 * because the runtime teardown stops every later component mounting at all.
 * So "the deck still drags" is the assertion that catches a broken die.
 *
 * Positions matter. Anything the specs click has to draw clear of the HUD
 * panes; `dragBy` fails loudly if it doesn't, because a pane over the target
 * looks identical to a frozen table.
